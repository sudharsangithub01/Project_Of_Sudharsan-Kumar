 8.	Retrieve month-by-month customer retention rate since the start of the business. (using views)

-- Tips: 
#1: Create a view where each userâ€™s visits are logged by month, 
-- allowing for the possibility that these will have occurred over multiple # years since whenever business started operations
# 2: Identify the time lapse between each visit. So, for each person and for each month, we see when the next visit is.
# 3: Calculate the time gaps between visits
# 4: categorise the customer with time gap 1 as retained, >1 as irregular and NULL as churned
# 5: calculate the retention month wise


-- #1 MONTH WISE VIEW OF CUSTOMERS VISITS LOGGED 
create view month_wise as
select distinct cust_id, year(order_date) Year, month(order_date) month, 
count(ord_id) over(PARTITION BY cust_id, year(order_date), month(order_date)) no_of_visits

select *, lead(month) over(partition by cust_id, year) as next_visit_month from month_wise)t1;

when difference = 1 then 'Retained'

end as categories from
